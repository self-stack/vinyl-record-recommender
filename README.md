## 1. Recommending Genre
**Description:** A album recommender system. I am an audiophile that invests heavily in my vinyl collection; I don't to own a record if there's only a few good songs on there. I want to enjoy the whole album as an experience. <br>
**My Approach:** Latent Component Analysis and Collab Filters.<br>
**Devilerables** (How will people react): Build website on flask for users to recieve Album recommendations. <br>
**Data:**<br>
- [__Spotify API__](http://millionsongdataset.com/)<br>
- [__Billboards API__](https://rapidapi.com/LDVIN/api/billboard-api/endpoints)<br>
- [__Discogs API__](https://www.discogs.com/developers)<br>
- [__MusicBrainz Cover Art Archive API__](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Cover_Art_Archive/API)<br>

## 2. Generate music using NN
**Description:** Generate music using CNN and/or RNN. <br>
**My Approach:** LTSM in RNNs<br>
**Devilerables** (How will people react): Build website on flask that will build and play a new song when site accessed. <br>
**Data:**<br>
- [__Spotify API__](http://millionsongdataset.com/)<br>
- [__Discogs API__](https://www.discogs.com/developers)<br>
